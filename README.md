# SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up!
---

## Data 
The database: [hawaii.sqlite](Resources/hawaii.sqlite) is provided by Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp.


## Climate Analysis and Exploration 
---

The main objective is to use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. The following analysis was completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

### Precipitation Analysis

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.

* Select only the `date` and `prcp` values.

* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

* Sort the DataFrame values by `date`.

* Plot the results using the DataFrame `plot` method.

* Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.


### Station Analysis

* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.

* Design a query to find the most active stations.

  * List the stations and observation counts in descending order.

  * Which station has the highest number of observations?

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).

  * Filter by the station with the highest number of observations.

  * Plot the results as a histogram with `bins=12`.

## Climate App 
---

The main objective here was to design a Flask API based on the queries developed.

### Routes

* `/`

  * Home page.

  * List all routes that are available.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

  * Convert the query results to a dictionary using `date` as the key and `prcp` as the value.

  * Return the JSON representation of your dictionary.

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  * Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`
  * Query the dates and temperature observations of the most active station for the last year of data.
  
  * Return a JSON list of temperature observations (TOBS) for the previous year.
